At the time of presentation, we used these two models only for prediction.

There are two more models described in USING_LSTM_SARIMAX.py, they were added later.

"""This code is using two models, one is Prophet by FB and the other one is a ARMA model, we are finding the parameters of ARMA model by Finding ACF and PACF and then setting up a threshold on them.
For most of the stickers (the stock for which you want the prediction), it will choose the ARMA model because that performed better on most stocks"""



"""Also, if we are using the prophet model then it will plot the seasonal plots also along with the prediction plots as that is a SARIMA model.
For ARMA model we will get the prediction for next seven days after the training date, we can set the training date appropriately to get the forecast for next seven days."""

"""The idea of using the last two days as the testing data actually helped to improve the predictions as using a single model in all the cases can lead to bad predictions in some cases."""
